# remove-duplicate-files
A simple Python script that loops through a specified directory and removes duplicate files. This only checks if filename has a (1), (2), etc at the end.

To use simply paste or copy your filepath of folders within the 'add file path here' on the line that states directory.

Note: This only check from 1 to 100 within the parentheses. You can change 100 to whatever you require.
